I'm Software Engineer working at [Wizeline](https://www.wizeline.com) since 2017. When I'm not working or playing PC games, I like to play [Screeps](https://screeps.com) (most of the time refactoring my code again and again) and practice my Python and JavaScript at [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com).

I already tried building my [own game](https://github.com/matheussampaio/game) (I'll try to continue in 2019) and I maintain a [Telegram Bot](https://github.com/matheussampaio/stack-overgol) to help a group of friends organizing their soccer matches.

You can find my [GitHub](https://github.com/matheussampaio) and my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheussampaio) below.
