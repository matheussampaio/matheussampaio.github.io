[`tldr`][1] ([Too long; didn't read][2]) is a command-line tool to quickly display a simplified man page.


It is very simple to use. Run `tldr <tool-name>`:
```bash
$ tldr tar
```

`tldr` will output a simplified man page:
```bash
tar

Archiving utility.
Often combined with a compression method, such as gzip or bzip.
More information: <https://www.gnu.org/software/tar>.

- Create an archive from files:
    tar -cf target.tar file1 file2 file3

- Create a gzipped archive:
    tar -czf target.tar.gz file1 file2 file3

- Extract an archive in a target directory:
    tar -xf source.tar -C directory

- Extract a gzipped archive in the current directory:
    tar -xzf source.tar.gz

- Extract a bzipped archive in the current directory:
    tar -xjf source.tar.bz2

- Create a compressed archive, using archive suffix to determine the compression program:
    tar -caf target.tar.xz file1 file2 file3

- List the contents of a tar file:
    tar -tvf source.tar

- Extract files matching a pattern:
    tar -xf source.tar --wildcards "*.html"
```
